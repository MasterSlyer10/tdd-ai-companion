# File Limit Warning Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a 5-file limit for both source and test file selection in the TDD AI Companion VS Code extension with proper warning messages displayed within the webview.

## Files Modified

### 1. `media/script.js`

- **Added warning helper functions:**

  - `showSourceFileLimitWarning()` - Creates and displays source file limit warning
  - `hideSourceFileLimitWarning()` - Hides source file limit warning
  - `showTestFileLimitWarning()` - Creates and displays test file limit warning
  - `hideTestFileLimitWarning()` - Hides test file limit warning

- **Modified `handleCheckboxChange()` function:**

  - Added `FILE_LIMIT = 5` constant
  - Implemented file limit validation before selection
  - Shows appropriate warnings when limit exceeded
  - Prevents file selection when limit would be exceeded
  - Hides warnings when file count drops below limit

- **Updated file chip removal logic:**

  - Updates local Sets (`checkedItems`, `checkedTestItems`) when files are removed
  - Hides warnings when file count drops to 5 or below after removal
  - Triggers state saving and tree re-rendering after removal

- **Enhanced `uncheckFileTreeItem` message handler:**
  - Hides warnings when files are unchecked from extension side
  - Handles both source and test file unchecking scenarios

### 2. `media/style.css`

- **Added `.file-limit-warning` class:**
  - Uses VS Code warning theme colors for consistent UI
  - Proper flexbox layout with warning icon
  - Matches existing "file-warning-message" disclaimer style
  - Includes hover effects and proper spacing

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. File Selection Limits

- **Source Files:** Maximum 5 files can be selected
- **Test Files:** Maximum 5 files can be selected
- **Independent Limits:** Source and test file limits are tracked separately

### 2. Warning Display

- **Inline Warnings:** Warnings appear within the webview (not VS Code popups)
- **Dynamic Visibility:**
  - Warnings show when trying to select the 6th file
  - Warnings hide when file count drops to 5 or below
- **Consistent Styling:** Uses existing "file-warning-message" style patterns

### 3. User Interactions

- **Checkbox Selection:** Prevents selection when limit exceeded
- **File Chip Removal:** Updates warnings when files are removed via chips
- **Extension Commands:** Properly updates warnings when files are removed via extension commands

## Logic Flow

### File Selection Process:

1. User attempts to select a file (checkbox or directory)
2. System counts current files + files to be added
3. If count > 5: Show warning, prevent selection
4. If count ≤ 5: Allow selection, hide warning if visible

### File Removal Process:

1. User removes file via chip or extension command
2. System updates local state (Sets)
3. If new count ≤ 5: Hide warning
4. Update UI and save state

## Test Scenarios

### Manual Testing Steps:

#### Source Files:

1. Open the TDD AI Companion sidebar
2. Navigate to "Source Files" section
3. Select 5 files - should work normally
4. Try to select a 6th file - warning should appear and selection should be prevented
5. Remove one file via chip - warning should disappear
6. Try selecting the 6th file again - should work now

#### Test Files:

1. Navigate to "Test Files" section
2. Repeat the same process as source files
3. Verify warnings work independently of source file warnings

#### Directory Selection:

1. Try selecting a directory with multiple files when already at limit
2. Warning should appear if total would exceed 5 files

#### File Removal:

1. Remove files via chip "×" buttons
2. Remove files via VS Code commands
3. Verify warnings update correctly in both cases

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management:

- `checkedItems` Set tracks source files
- `checkedTestItems` Set tracks test files
- Both are synchronized with VS Code extension state

### Warning Elements:

- Dynamically created/removed DOM elements
- Inserted after respective tree containers
- Use VS Code theme variables for consistent appearance

### Event Handling:

- File selection events check limits before allowing changes
- File removal events update warnings immediately
- Extension message handlers properly update warning visibility

## Success Criteria ✅

1. **File Limit Enforcement:** ✅ Maximum 5 files for both source and test
2. **Warning Display:** ✅ Warnings appear within webview, not as VS Code popups
3. **Warning Styling:** ✅ Consistent with existing "file-warning-message" style
4. **Independent Limits:** ✅ Source and test files tracked separately
5. **Dynamic Updates:** ✅ Warnings show/hide based on current file count
6. **User Experience:** ✅ Clear feedback when limits are reached
7. **File Removal:** ✅ Warnings update when files are removed via chips or commands

## Ready for Testing:

- Extension can be tested by pressing F5 in VS Code to launch Extension Development Host

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. The file limit warnings provide clear feedback to users while maintaining the existing UI consistency.
